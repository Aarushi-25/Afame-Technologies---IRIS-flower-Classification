# Afame-Technologies-IRIS-flower-Classification

This repository contains code for a machine learning project focused on classifying Iris flowers into different species based on their sepal and petal measurements. The project utilizes the famous Iris flower dataset, a commonly used dataset in the field of machine learning.

Dataset:

The Iris flower dataset is a multivariate dataset introduced by the British statistician and biologist Ronald Fisher in his 1936 paper, "The Use of multiple measurements in Taxonomic Problems." Edgar Anderson collected the data to quantify the morphologic variation of Iris flowers of three related species. The dataset comprises 150 samples, with 50 samples from each of three species of Iris: Iris setosa, Iris virginica, and Iris versicolor. For each sample, four features were measured: the length and width of both the sepals and petals, all in centimeters.

Objective:

The primary objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model capable of accurately classifying Iris flowers into their respective species based on their measurements. The model aims to learn patterns from the features provided in the dataset and generalize well to classify unseen Iris flowers correctly.

Motivation:

Educational Purposes: This project serves as an educational resource for individuals learning about machine learning classification techniques. By working with a well-known dataset like Iris, beginners can gain practical experience in data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and deployment.

Demonstration of Classification Techniques: The Iris dataset is a classic example often used to demonstrate various classification algorithms due to its simplicity and effectiveness in showcasing fundamental concepts such as feature selection, model training, and performance evaluation.

Real-world Application: While the Iris dataset may seem simplistic, the concepts and techniques employed in this project can be extended to more complex real-world classification problems. By understanding how to classify Iris flowers based on their measurements, learners can apply similar methodologies to tackle more challenging classification tasks in diverse domains.
